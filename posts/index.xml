As soon as I saw a post with rust support for micro:bit I purchased it without any hesitation. So now lets see what this awesome development board has got.
The board is slick with minimal design (according to me).
If the pic looks overwhelming, relax, we are going to decode the components that matter the most as a developer.
Application Processor Our code is executed in the application processor.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post explain what micro:bit has to offer.

<h2 id="application-processor">Application Processor</h2>
<hr>
<p>Our code is executed in the application processor.</p>
<p><img src="/static/micro-bit/micro-bit-v2-main-processor.png" alt="micro:bit hardware"></p>
<p>The processor is an <a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m4">Arm Cortex-M4 32 bit processor</a> supporting cool features like</p>
<ol>
<li>25 General Purpose Input Ouput (GPIO) pins</li>
<li>64MHz Clock speed</li>
<li>512kB Flash ROM</li>
<li>128kB RAM</li>
<li>2.4Ghz Radio transceiver</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</li>
<li>Support for NFC</li>
</ol>
<p>The GPIOs provides the interface for external devices to talk with the processor.</p>
<h2 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
<hr>
<p><img src="/static/micro-bit/microbit-drawing-back-bluetooth-antenna.png" alt="micro:bit hardware"></p>
<p>The on-board 2.4GHz antenna provides the required transceiver for setting up a bluetooth connection. The <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Software/S113">Nordic S113 SoftDevice</a> provides the BLE energy stack to easily communicate with other Bluetooth devices. With this current protocol stack, upto 4 connections, as a Peripheral, can connect concurrently to a Broadcaster.</p>
<p>With the 2.4GHz its possible to connect with multiple devices that operate in this range including WiFi in the 2.4GHz range, wireless microphone, speakers, etc.</p>
<h2 id="peripherals">Peripherals</h2>
<hr>
<p>The bunch of other peripherals present connected on-boards are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speaker</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Accelerometer</li>
<li>Microphone</li>
<li>5x5 LED matrix</li>
<li>Tactile buttons</li>
<li>GPIOs</li>
<li>Temperature Sensor</li>
</ol>
<p>All these peripherals are clearly marked on the board for easy identification.</p>
