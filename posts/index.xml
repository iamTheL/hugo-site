<h2 id="application-processor">Application Processor</h2>
<hr>
<p>Our code is executed in the application processor.</p>
<p><img src="/static/micro-bit/micro-bit-v2-main-processor.png" alt="micro:bit hardware"></p>
<p>The processor is an <a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m4">Arm Cortex-M4 32 bit processor</a> supporting cool features like</p>
<ol>
<li>25 General Purpose Input Ouput (GPIO) pins</li>
<li>64MHz Clock speed</li>
<li>512kB Flash ROM</li>
<li>128kB RAM</li>
<li>2.4Ghz Radio transceiver</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</li>
<li>Support for NFC</li>
</ol>
<p>The GPIOs provides the interface for external devices to talk with the processor.</p>
<h2 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
<hr>
<p><img src="/static/micro-bit/microbit-drawing-back-bluetooth-antenna.png" alt="micro:bit hardware"></p>
<p>The on-board 2.4GHz antenna provides the required transceiver for setting up the bluetooth connection. The <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Software/S113">Nordic S113 SoftDevice</a> provides the BLE energy stack to easily communicate with other Bluetooth devices. With this current protocol stack, upto 4 connections, as a Peripheral, can connect concurrently to a Broadcaster.</p>
<p>With the 2.4GHz transceiver its possible to connect with multiple devices that operate in this range including WiFi in the 2.4GHz range, wireless microphone, speakers, etc.</p>
<h2 id="peripherals">Peripherals</h2>
<hr>
<p>The bunch of other peripherals present connected on-boards are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speaker</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Accelerometer</li>
<li>Microphone</li>
<li>5x5 LED matrix</li>
<li>Tactile buttons</li>
<li>GPIOs</li>
<li>Temperature Sensor</li>
</ol>
<p>All these peripherals are clearly marked on the board for easy identification.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<hr>
<p>micro:bit is easily programmable with micro-python and rust.</p>
<p>For python there are really cool gamified online editors like</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/">MakeCode editor</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://python.microbit.org/v/2">Python online editor</a></p>
<p>All these come with easy plugins to push code to micro:bit</p>
</li>
</ol>
