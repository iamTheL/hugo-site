Web APIs are exposed through REST style over HTTP/HTTPS in our coding example.
Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) / Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure(HTTPS) specifies verbs over which data is transferred between a client and server.
Hopefully if you are following up on my series you would have deduced by now that we are setting up an client-server architecture.</description></item><item><title>Spring Boot Series - Classical Hello World !!</title><link>https://paddymano.github.io/posts/spring-boot-series/classical-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 11:05:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://paddymano.github.io/posts/spring-boot-series/classical-hello-world/</guid><description>Classical Hello World application using Spring Boot
Spring boot is one of the popular Java framework, which under the hood comprises of multiple Spring based Java projects at its core. Spring boot helps to get started with stand-alone Spring based applications with minimal coding.
Spring boot provides an Embedded Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow runtime environments for the jar/war to run as stand-alone applications along with many other useful features.
Web applications are developed at a faster phase using Spring boot owing to its inherent support for simplifying web development.</description></item><item><title>Spring Boot Series - Food Ordering App</title><link>https://paddymano.github.io/posts/spring-boot-series/a-index/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 11:05:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://paddymano.github.io/posts/spring-boot-series/a-index/</guid><description>Spring boot series revolves around designing and developing a food delivery application using Spring Boot framework. The idea here is to share my experience with Spring boot in designing a solution with as many features as possible. All the working components of the application will be listed as a lookup for the entire series in this post.
I will try my best to post it sequentially for a smoother navigation even though each post is a stand-alone post addressing one feature at a time.</description></item></channel></rss>
